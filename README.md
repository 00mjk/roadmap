# GitHub Product Roadmap

In this repo, you can find the [official GitHub product roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap/projects/2). The roadmap is currently in a read-only state, with locked conversations, as we get started. However, we anticipate being able to engage more in discussions about the future of GitHub products and features, here on GitHub, soon.

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the discussion over on the [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/).

## Guide to the Roadmap

Every item on the GitHub product roadmap is an issue, twith a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **feature stage** that describes the next expected stage of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to product stages. 

- A **milestone** that indicates the quarter in which we expect to deliver the next stage of the feature. You can also use the Project tab to see a milestone-by-milestone view.

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- One or more **product SKU** labels that indicate which product SKUs we expect the feature to be available in. For a list of current product SKUs, see below.

- One or more **deployment models** (cloud and/or server). Where not stated, features will generally come out cloud first, and follow on server at or soon after GA.

## Feature Stages

Every feature goes through a set of stages, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha:** *Primarily for testing and feedback*\
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.

- **beta:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*\
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

- **ga:** *Generally available to all customers*\
Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows: 

- **in design:**\
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Milestones

The GitHub product roadmap is arranged on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Every feature is labeled with a quarter in which we expect to deliver the next stage of the feature. The indicated milestone is our best known estimate, and may change as we do development.

GitHub Enterprise Server has major releases on a quarterly basis, and minor releases on a monthly basis. Once we know what version we are delivering a feature, we will update the issue to indicate that information.
